Title: Network-Based Regularization for Generalized Linear Models
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Jie Ren, Luann C. Jung, Yinhao Du, Cen Wu, Yu Jiang, Junhao Liu
Maintainer: Jie Ren <jieren@ksu.edu>
Description: Network-based regularization has achieved success in variable selection for 
    high-dimensional biological data due to its ability to incorporate correlations among 
    genomic features. This package provides procedures of network-based variable selection 
    for generalized linear models (Ren et al. (2017) <doi:10.1186/s12863-017-0495-5> and 
	Ren et al.(2019) <doi:10.1002/gepi.22194>). Continuous, binary, and survival response 
	are supported. Robust network-based methods are available for continuous and survival 
	responses.
