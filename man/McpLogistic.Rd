\title{MCP logistic regression for a given lambda.}
\usage{
McpLogistic(X, Y, lambda, r = 5, alpha.i = 1, folds = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a matrix of predictors.}

\item{Y}{a vector of the binary response.}

\item{lambda}{the tunning parameter lambda imposes sparsity.}

\item{r}{the regularization parameter in MCP.}

\item{alpha.i}{by default, the program use the lasso for choosing initial values of
the coefficient vector. alpha.i is the elastic-net mixing parameter, with \eqn{0 \le alpha.i \le 1}. alpha.i=1 is the
lasso penalty, and alpha.i=0 the ridge penalty. If assign alpha.i to be -1, program will use zero
as initial coefficients.}

\item{folds}{the number of folds for cross-validation.}
}
\value{
the estimated coefficients vector.
}
\description{
This function makes predictions for MCP logistic for a given value of lambda1.
Typical usage is to have the CV.MCPLogistic function compute the optimal lambda, then provide it to
the McpLogistic function.
}
\examples{
b = McpLogistic(regnet$X, regnet$Y, 0.075)
regnet$beta # the ture coefficient
