\title{Elastic-Net logistic regression for a given lambda.}
\usage{
ElasLogistic(X, Y, lambda, alpha = 0.5, alpha.i = 1, folds = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a matrix of predictors.}

\item{Y}{a vector of the binary response.}

\item{lambda}{the tuning parameter that imposes sparsity.}

\item{alpha}{the Elastic-Net mixing parameter, with \eqn{0 \le \alpha \le 1}. alpha=1 is the lasso penalty, and alpha=0 the ridge penalty.}

\item{alpha.i}{by default, the program use the lasso for choosing initial values of
the coefficient vector. alpha.i is the Elastic-Net mixing parameter, with \eqn{0 \le alpha.i \le 1}. alpha.i=1 is the
lasso penalty, and alpha.i=0 the ridge penalty. If alpha.i is assigned as -1, the program will use zeroes
as initial coefficients.}

\item{folds}{the number of folds for cross-validation.}
}
\value{
the estimated coefficients vector.
}
\description{
This function makes predictions for Elastic-Net logistic regression for a given value of lambda.
Typical usage is to have the CV.ElasLogistic function compute the optimal lambda, then provide it to
the ElasLogistic function.
}
\examples{
b = ElasLogistic(regnet$X, regnet$Y, 0.04)
inds = which(regnet$beta != 0)
sel = which(b != 0)
tp = length(intersect(inds, sel))
fp = length(sel) - tp
list(tp=tp, fp=fp)
