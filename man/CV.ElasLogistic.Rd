\title{k-folds cross-validation for Elastic-net logistic regression.}
\usage{
CV.ElasLogistic(X, Y, lambda = NULL, alpha = 0.5, alpha.i = 1,
  folds = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a matrix of predictors.}

\item{Y}{a vector of the binary response.}

\item{lambda}{a user-supplied sequence of lambda. Tuning parameter lambda imposes sparsity.
If it is left as NULL, a default sequence will be used.}

\item{alpha}{the elastic-net mixing parameter, with \eqn{0 \le \alpha \le 1}. alpha=1 is the lasso penalty,
and alpha=0 the ridge penalty.}

\item{alpha.i}{by default, the program use the lasso for choosing initial values of
the coefficient vector. alpha.i is the elastic-net mixing parameter, with \eqn{0 \le alpha.i \le 1}. alpha.i=1 is the
lasso penalty, and alpha.i=0 the ridge penalty. If assign alpha.i to be -1, program will use zero
as initial coefficients.}

\item{folds}{the number of folds for cross-validation.}
}
\value{
a list with components:
\item{lambda}{the optimal lambda.}
\item{mcr}{the misclassification rate of the optimal lambda.}
\item{MCR}{a matrix of the misclassification rates for all the values of lambda tested.}
}
\description{
This function dose k-fold cross-validation for the Elastic-net logistic regression and returns
a value of lambda.
